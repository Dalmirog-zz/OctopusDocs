There are times when you might like to run Tentacle under a specific user. This might be required for scenarios where you need to:

- Run a script that needs to be executed by a user with higher permissions
- Run a process that talks to a SQL database, and you want to use integrated authentication.

:::hint
Please note that this means that everything that Tentacle does will run as this user, so the permissions need to account for this.
:::

The first step will be to log on to your server where the Tentacle is hosted. You then need to find the Tentacle service.

From here you can find the Tentacle service and choose Properties.

Under Log On you can set the user to be a specific user.
