Octopus step templates are reusable steps based on the built-in steps with your own specific parameters and instructions.  Octopus supports two types of step templates.  Custom step templates and community step templates.

- Custom step templates are templates created within Octopus to encapsulate common steps/scenarios with a team or company.  Often they're built to encapsulate everything required to accomplish a task working with a specific framework or technology
- Community step templates are custom step templates that have shared for others to take advantage of
