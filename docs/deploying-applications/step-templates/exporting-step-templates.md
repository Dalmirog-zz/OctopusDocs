If you want to transport, backup, or share your Step Templates with the community, you can export a template by finding your template in {{Library,Step templates}}, and clicking the **Export** link.

Now you can take that exported template document and commit it to source control, or share it on theÂ [Community Library](https://library.octopusdeploy.com/).

:::success
Take a look at the [contributing guide](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Library/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the Community Library and submit your step template as a [pull request](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Library/pulls).
