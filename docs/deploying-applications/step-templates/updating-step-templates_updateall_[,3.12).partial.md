If you have a lot of projects using a step template, updating them can be time consuming. [We've automated this process](index.md) in Octopus `3.12`.  If you can't upgrade to that version then you might want to have a look at  a third-party solution called [BlueFin Chrome extension for Octopus](http://bluefin.teapotcoder.com/) which allows you to update steps across all of your projects.
