These scripts are executed on the Octopus Server and will be pre-authenticated using the selected Azure Account. For information about adding a step to the deployment process, see the [add step](/docs/deploying-applications/adding-steps.md) section.

:::hint
Refer to [this guide](/docs/guides/azure-deployments/creating-an-azure-account/index.md) for more details, and the impact of choosing the right kind of Azure Account on the Azure SDK that will be available.

## Example {#AzurePowerShellscripts-Example}

This example uses the Service Management API to create a new Staging slot as part of the [blue/green deployment sample for Azure Web Apps](/docs/deploying-applications/deploying-to-azure/deploying-a-package-to-an-azure-web-app/using-deployment-slots-with-azure-web-apps.md).

```powershell
#Remove the staging slot if it exists
Remove-AzureWebsite -Name #{WebSite} -Slot Staging -Force
 
#Create the staging slot
New-AzureWebsite -Name #{WebSite} -Slot Staging
```

## Bring your own Azure SDK {#AzurePowerShellscripts-BringyourownAzureSDK}

We bundle a version of the Azure SDKs with Octopus Server so you can start deploying to Azure very quickly. In certain situations you may want (or need) to use a different version of the Azure SDK. Refer to [this guide](/docs/guides/azure-deployments/running-azure-powershell/configuring-the-version-of-the-azure-powershell-modules.md) for more details.
