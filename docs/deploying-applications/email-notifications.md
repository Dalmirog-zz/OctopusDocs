Deployments can have a strong impact on others whose work depends on the system being deployed. Great communication is an important part of a great deployment strategy, and email steps are a key way that Octopus can help you keep everyone in the loop. You may wish to:

- Notify stakeholders when a new version of an app has been deployed to production
- Let testers know when a new version is available in UAT
- Use email in conjuction with [manual approvals](/docs/deploying-applications/manual-intervention-and-approvals.md) to make sure everyone is ready for a new deployment

To support this, Octopus provides **Email Steps** in a project's deployment process.

!toc

## SMTP configuration

You'll need to enter SMTP server settings in {{Configuration,SMTP}} before Octopus will be able to send any email.

## Adding an email step {#Emailnotifications-Addinganemailstep}

Email can be chosen as the step type when you click **Add Step** in your project's **Process** tab. For information about adding a step to the deployment process, see the [add step](/docs/deploying-applications/adding-steps.md) section.

![Email Step Icon](/docs/images/5671696/5865915.png "width=170")

When adding an email step, you can choose the subject of the email, its body, and the recipients to send it to.

![Email Step Example](email-notifications.png "width=500")

## Choosing recipients

You have several options for choosing the recipients of your email:

1. Enter a comma-separated list of email addresses
2. Bind to a variable which defines a list of email addresses (this is really useful for tailoring your recipient list per-environment)
3. Choose one or more teams to include members of those teams in the recipient list
4. Use a combination of all of these options

Octopus will build the resulting recipient list during the deployment, deduplicate the list of email addresses, and send the email to each recipient.

![Email Recipients](email-notifications-recipients.png "width=500")

## Choosing when to send the email notification

You can choose when to send the email notification using the same conditions as for any other step in Octopus.

- Send the email only for successful deployments to certain environments
- Send a specific email for failed deployments
- Send an email based on the value of a variable expression which works really well with [output variables](/docs/deploying-applications/variables/output-variables.md)

## Email content {#Emailnotifications-Exampleemailtemplates}

You can set the email subject and author the email body as plain text or HTML content. You can even use the Octopus [variable syntax](/docs/reference/variable-substitution-syntax.md) to include information about the deployment in the email.

:::hint
The binding helper to the right of each form field can be used to view the available variables.

The template below collects basic information about the deployment, including the package versions included in each step.

**Deployment summary template**

```xml
<h1>Deployment of #{Octopus.Project.Name} #{Octopus.Release.Number} to #{Octopus.Environment.Name}</h1>
<p>
  <em>Initiated by
    #{unless Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.DisplayName}#{Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.Username}#{/unless}
    #{if Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.DisplayName}#{Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.DisplayName}#{/if}
    #{if Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.EmailAddress} (<a href="mailto: #{Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.EmailAddress}">#{Octopus.Deployment.CreatedBy.EmailAddress}</a>)#{/if}
    at #{Octopus.Deployment.Created}</em>
</p>
#{if Octopus.Release.Notes}
<h2>Release notes</h2>
<p>#{Octopus.Release.Notes}</p>
#{/if}
<h2>Deployment process</h2>
<p>The deployment included the following actions:</p>
<ul>
  #{each action in Octopus.Action}
    <li><strong>#{action.Name}</strong> #{if action.Package.NuGetPackageId}&mdash; <a href="http://nuget.org/packages/#{action.Package.NuGetPackageId}">#{action.Package.NuGetPackageId}</a> <em>version #{action.Package.NuGetPackageVersion}#{/if}</em></li>
  #{/each}
</ul>
<p>View the <a href="http://my-octopus#{Octopus.Web.DeploymentLink}">detailed deployment log</a>.</p>
```

:::hint
To use the template in your projects, replace `nuget.org` with the DNS name of your NuGet server, and `my-octopus` with the DNS name of your Octopus server. Make sure you select *Body is HTML* on the email step configuration page.
:::

The output of the template will be an HTML email like:

### Including step status {#Emailnotifications-Includingstepstatus}

The outcome of each step can be included using a template like the one below (Octopus 2.5+):

**Step status summary template**

```xml
<h3>Task summary</h3>
<ol>
#{each step in Octopus.Step}
  #{if step.Status.Code}
    <li>#{step | HtmlEscape} &mdash; <strong>#{step.Status.Code}</strong> 
    #{if step.Status.Error}
      <pre>#{step.Status.Error | HtmlEscape}</pre>
      <pre>#{step.Status.ErrorDetail | HtmlEscape}</pre>
    #{/if}  
    </li>
  #{/if}
#{/each}
</ol>
```

:::hint
**Step error detail**
`step.Status.Error` and `step.Status.ErrorDetail` will only display the exit code and Octopus stack trace for the error. As we cannot parse the deployment log, we can only extract the exit/error codes. It cannot show detailed information on what caused the error. For full information on what happened when the deployment fails, you will need to reference the logs.

See [System variables](/docs/deploying-applications/variables/system-variables.md)
