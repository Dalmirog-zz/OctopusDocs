To prevent [retention policies](/docs/administration/retention-policies/index.md) for one channel from impacting deployments for another channel, version `3.12.2` introduces the `Discrete Channel Releases` flag at under `Deployment Target settings` on the {{Project,Process}} page. Enabling this feature will also ensure that your project overview dashboard correctly shows which releases are current for each environment _in each channel_. Without this set, the default behavior is for releases across channels to supersede each other (for example, in a hotfix scenario where the `3.2.2-bugfix` is expected to override the `3.2.2` release, allowng `3.2.2` to be considered for retention policy cleanup).
