Consider the following scenario:

> NameBadge make HR software for large corporate customers. They provide the software as a SaaS offering to their customers, and host the web site and associated services for them. Due to how the application is architected, for each customer, they deploy:
>
> - A different SQL database
> - A copy of an ASP.NET website
> - A copy of a Windows Service

The key issue in this scenario is that the same components need to be deployed multiple times, one for each end-customer.
