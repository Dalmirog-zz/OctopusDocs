While [using OctoPack](/docs/packaging-applications/nuget-packages/using-octopack/index.md) is the preferred way to create NuGet packages for Octopus, OctoPack has some limitations: namely, it has to be installed into a C# or Visual Basic project.

For other scenarios, you can use the NuGet.exe command line tool to create packages.

:::hint
You can download Nuget and read full documentation on NuGet.exe usage at the [NuGet.exe pack command line reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/nuget-exe-cli-reference).
