For Listening Tentacles, the Octopus Server can be configured to communicate with the Tentacle via a proxy. Go to {{Environments,Proxies}} to configure proxy servers to use when connecting to Listening Tentacles. Multiple proxies can be setup here depending on the requirements of your network topology.
