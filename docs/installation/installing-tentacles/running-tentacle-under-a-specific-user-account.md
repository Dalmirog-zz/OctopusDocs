description: Information on how to run Tentacle under a specific user account.

Every process within a Tentacle is executed by the user account configured on the **Octopus Tentacle** service. By default this account is **Local System**. There are times when you might like to run the Tentacle under a specific user account (i.e. you want to run administrator-level commands from your deployment process).

To change this setting go to {{Services,Octopus Tentacle,Properties,Log On}}.

If possible making the user a local administrator will be the easiest path to full functionality. If this is not possible, the following table acts as a guide for the minimal permission set that Tentacle must have for successful operation.

| Permission   | Object                                   | Reason                                   | Applied with     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Full control | The Octopus "Home" folder, e.g. `C:\Octopus` | Tentacle stores logs, temporary data, and dynamic configuration in this folder | Windows Explorer |
| Read         | The `HLKM\Software\Octopus\Tentacle` registry key | Tentacle determines the location of its configuration files from this key | Regedit          |
| Full control | The `Octopus Tentacle` Windows Service   | Tentacle must be able to upgrade and restart itself for remote administration | SC.EXE           |
| Listen       | Port **10933**                           | Tentacle accepts commands from Octopus on this port | NETSH.EXE        |

Additional permissions will be necessary depending on the kinds of deployments Tentacle will perform (e.g. IIS configuration and so-on).
