---

The Octopus Deploy Server is software that you download and install on one of your own servers, just like you would install Microsoft SQL Server. The Octopus Deploy Server:

- runs as a Windows Service
- stores its data in a [SQL Server database](/docs/administration/octopus-database/index.md)
- has an embedded HTTP server which serves the [Octopus REST API](/docs/api-and-integration/octopus-rest-api.md) and presents the main Octopus user interface (the **Octopus Web Portal**)
- orchestrates your automated deployments

## Requirements {#InstallingOctopus-Requirements}

To successfully install Octopus Server you will need:

- A Windows Server with the correct version of .NET Framework installed (see below)
- A Microsoft SQL Server instance which can be accessed by your Octopus Server ([more details](/docs/installation/installing-octopus/sql-server-database-requirements.md))

### Hardware requirements

There is no "one size fits all" approach for Octopus Server. The best approach is to start with a working Octopus Server, start deploying your applications while monitoring your server statistics, and scale from there.

- Absolute minimum to make it run: 512MB RAM, 1GHz CPU, 2GB free disk space
- Recommended starting point for smaller deployments (less than 30 deployment targets for example): 2GB RAM, dual-core CPU, 10GB free disk space
- Recommended starting point for larger deployments: 4GB RAM, dual-core, 20GB free disk space

Learn about [Octopus Server performance](/docs/administration/performance.md).

### Windows Server requirements

Octopus Server can be installed on the following versions of Windows Server:

- Windows Server 2008 SP2
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016

Some versions of Octopus Server require a different minimum version of the .NET Framework to be installed on the server:

- Octopus 3.0.0 - 3.3.27 requires [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=30653) or newer
- Octopus 3.4 onward requires [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=40773) or newer

#### Windows Server Core

Whilst Octopus Server will run on "Windows Server Core", the easiest installation path is to use "Windows Server with a GUI" and run our installation wizard. If you want to use "Windows Server Core" you will need to add some missing Windows Features and configure Octopus Server yourself. Learn about [automating installation](/docs/installation/installing-octopus/automating-installation.md).

## Downloading the installer

The latest Octopus Deploy MSI can always be [downloaded from the Octopus Deploy downloads page](https://octopus.com/downloads). You can also download any [previous releases](https://octopus.com/downloads/previous) from our archive.

If you plan to [script your installation](/docs/installation/installing-octopus/automating-installation.md), you can use one of these [permalinks](/docs/reference/download-permalinks.md) to automate the download.

### Using a Managed Service Account (MSA) {#InstallingOctopus-UsingaManagedServiceAccount(MSA)}

You can run the Octopus Server using a Managed Service Account (MSA):

1. Install the Octopus Server and make sure it is running correctly using one of the built-in Windows Service accounts or a Custom Account
1. Reconfigure the Octopus Server Windows Service to use the MSA, either manually using the Service snap-in, or using `sc.exe config "OctopusDeploy" obj= Domain\Username$`
1. Restart the Octopus Server Windows Service

Learn about [using Managed Service Accounts](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd548356(v=ws.10).aspx).

## Troubleshooting {#InstallingOctopus-Troubleshooting}

In a few cases a bug in a 3rd party component causes the installer displays a "Installation directory must be on a local hard drive" error. If this occurs, running the install again from an elevated command prompt using the following command (replacing Octopus.3.3.4-x64.msi with the name of the installer you are using)

`msiexec /i Octopus.3.3.4-x64.msi WIXUI_DONTVALIDATEPATH="1"`

:::warning
**Deploying applications to an Azure website?**
If you get the following error it means you have a local copy of Web Deploy and that is being used. You will either need to upgrade your local version of Web Deploy to 3.5 or greater, or uninstall the local copy so Octopus can reference the embedded copy.
